# AC-DBD Demo Case

This tutorial simulates the AC-driven sDBD asymmetric actuator, using the geometry of Durcher and Roy [1]. The plasma actuator is placed in quiescent air and is powered by a sinusoidal high voltage $V_{p-p}=20~ kV$ and frequency $f=14~ kHz$. 

The thickness if the dielectric plate of the actuator is $3~mm$, and the electrodes' $70~\mu m$. The length of the high-voltage and the gounded electrode is $5$ and $20~mm$, respectively. There is no inter-electrode gap. The dielectric plate is made of Kapton $(\varepsilon_r=3.0)$ and the grounded electrode is encapsulated into dielectric material with dielectric constant $\varepsilon_r=3.7$.

In this demo case. 5 discharge events have been inmposed during the first half of the positive negative-cycle (between $T/2$ and $3T/4$). The distance between the discharge events is $4.464286~\mu s$. The charge density of each discharge is set to $\rho_c=0.01~C/m$ 

More information of the usage of the three-stage model and the solution procedure can be found in Vafakos *et al.* [2]
